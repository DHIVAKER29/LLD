Refactoring Pricing Calculation with the Strategy Pattern
Problem Statement
You are tasked with refactoring a pricing calculator for a ride-sharing app. The existing pricing manager class (PricingManager) uses a monolithic approach to calculate ride prices based on different strategies: distance-based, time-based, and surge pricing. The goal is to refactor the code to use the Strategy pattern, allowing for more flexible pricing strategies and better maintenance.

Assignment
Your task is to refactor the PricingManager class to use the Strategy pattern effectively. You will create separate pricing strategy classes for each pricing type (distance-based, time-based, surge) by implementing the PricingStrategy interface. Each strategy class will provide its own implementation for calculating the ride price.

Distance-Based Pricing
Calculate the ride price based on the distance traveled.
Base fare: $5.0
Rate per kilometer: $2.0
Time-Based Pricing
Calculate the ride price based on the duration of the ride.
Base fare: $5.0
Rate per minute: $0.5
Surge Pricing
Implement surge pricing logic to increase the ride price during peak hours.
Surge multiplier: 2.0 (e.g., 2x the base price)
By implementing the Strategy pattern, you'll have a more flexible and maintainable pricing calculator that can accommodate various pricing strategies, making it easier to adjust pricing rules in the future.

Implementing the Strategy Pattern
Create the PricingStrategy Interface: Begin by creating the PricingStrategy interface. This interface should define a method for calculating the ride price.

Implement Concrete Pricing Strategy Classes: Create concrete classes that implement the PricingStrategy interface. These classes will represent different pricing strategies, including:

Distance-based pricing: Calculate the price based on the distance traveled.
Time-based pricing: Calculate the price based on the duration of the ride.
Surge pricing: Implement surge pricing logic.
Refactor the PricingManager Class: Refactor the existing PricingManager class by removing the hardcoded pricing logic and instead delegating the price calculation to the selected pricing strategy. The PricingManager class should now use composition to hold an instance of the selected pricing strategy.

Test Your Refactored Code: Write test cases to ensure that the refactored code produces accurate pricing calculations for each pricing strategy. You should test different scenarios to verify that each strategy behaves as expected.
